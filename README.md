## Super Secret Project Bravo

### A project to create easy to follow course templates

- GOALS
  - Make course development work consistently
  - Ensure content is subdivided into "chunks" that facilitate effective learning
  - Have consistent flow and structure for planning and building labs
  - Provide a "single source of truth" for course content under distributed version control

- FUTURE GOALS
  - Future versions could include scripts or Ansible playbooks for:
    - Lab configuration and/or automation
    - Grading lab results
    - ??? 

The basic "model" works like this:
- Day 1
  - Module 1
    - Lesson 1
      - Topic 1
        - TRY IT LAB (AS NEEDED)
      - Topic X  
        - TRY IT LAB (AS NEEDED)
      - Lesson Review
        - HANDS ON EXERCISE LAB
    - Lesson X
      - (REPEAT AS LESSON ABOVE)
    - Module Review
      - END OF MODULE LAB  
  - Module X
    - (REPEAT AS MODULE ABOVE)  
- Day X
  - (REPEAT AS DAY ABOVE)
